# Spätzle check

Me and my colleges have been eating in the Mensa at our university for a while now. If spätzle are on the menu it was always a gamble if they are good or really bad. Until somebody told us the problem of the bad spätzle is that they are vegan (no hate against vegan products but some products just shouldn't be vegan). 


Because of the lack of eggs the spätzle are not sticking together and are just a big pile of mush.

Using the allergen information on the mensa website we can check if the spätzle are vegan or not and therefore can decide if one can eat them or not. 

This project serves a simple [website](spaetzle.traberph.de) that checks the spätzle for you.
